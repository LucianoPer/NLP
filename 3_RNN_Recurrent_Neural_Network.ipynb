People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall” You thought they were all kiddin’ you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin’ out Now you don’t talk so loud Now you don’t seem so proud About having to be scrounging for your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it You said you’d never compromise With the mystery tramp, but now you realize He’s not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And ask him do you want to make a deal? How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns When they all come down and did tricks for you You never understood that it ain’t no good You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain’t it hard when you discover that He really wasn’t where it’s at After he took from you everything he could steal How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone? Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son” Abe says, “Man, you must be puttin’ me on” God say, “No.” Abe say, “What?” God say, “You can do what you want Abe, but The next time you see me comin’ you better run” Well Abe says, “Where do you want this killin’ done?” God says, “Out on Highway 61” Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there’s only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Ol’ Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings And a thousand telephones that don’t ring Do you know where I can get rid of these things And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son And he said yes I think it can be easily done Just take everything down to Highway 61 Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night Told the first father that things weren’t right My complexion she said is much too white He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you’re right Let me tell the second mother this has been done But the second mother was with the seventh son And they were both out on Highway 61 Now the rovin’ gambler he was very bored He was tryin’ to create a next world war He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before But yes I think it can be very easily done We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun And have it on Highway 61 Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’ I was layin’ in bed Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was gonna be rough They never did like Mama’s homemade dress Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough And I was standin’ on the side of the road Rain fallin’ on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through Tangled up in blue She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walkin’ away I heard her say over my shoulder “We’ll meet again someday on the avenue” Tangled up in blue I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I happened to be employed Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew Tangled up in blue She was workin’ in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face In the spotlight so clear And later on as the crowd thinned out I’s just about to do the same She was standing there in back of my chair Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?” I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe “I thought you’d never say hello,” she said “You look like the silent type” Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burnin’ coal Pourin’ off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafés at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue So now I’m goin’ back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know They’re an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenters’ wives Don’t know how it all got started I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives But me, I’m still on the road Headin’ for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue How many roads must a man walk down Before you call him a man? Yes, ’n’ how many seas must a white dove sail Before she sleeps in the sand? Yes, ’n’ how many times must the cannonballs fly Before they’re forever banned?

Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have Before he can hear people cry? Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows That too many people have died? The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind The answer is blowin’ in the wind You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked And you say, “Who is that man?” You try so hard But you don’t understand Just what you’ll say When you get home Because something is happening here But you don’t know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?

Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you Come you masters of war You that build all the guns You that build the death planes You that build the big bombs You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothin’ But build to destroy You play with my world Like it’s your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from my eyes And you turn and run farther When the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe But I see through your eyes And I see through your brain Like I see through the water That runs down my drain You fasten the triggers For the others to fire Then you set back and watch When the death count gets higher You hide in your mansion As young people’s blood Flows out of their bodies And is buried in the mud You’ve thrown the worst fear That can ever be hurled Fear to bring children Into the world For threatening my baby Unborn and unnamed You ain’t worth the blood That runs in your veins How much do I know To talk out of turn You might say that I’m young You might say I’m unlearned But there’s one thing I know Though I’m younger than you Even Jesus would never Forgive what you do Let me ask you one question Is your money that good Will it buy you forgiveness Do you think that it could I think you will find When your death takes its toll All the money you made Will never buy back your soul And I hope that you die And your death’ll come soon I will follow your casket In the pale afternoon And I’ll watch while you’re lowered Down to your deathbed And I’ll stand o’er your grave ’Til I’m sure that you’re dead Nobody feels any pain Tonight as I stand inside the rain Ev’rybody knows That Baby’s got new clothes But lately I see her ribbons and her bows Have fallen from her curls She takes just like a woman, yes, she does She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl Queen Mary, she’s my friend Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again Nobody has to guess That Baby can’t be blessed Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls She takes just like a woman, yes, she does She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl It was raining from the first And I was dying there of thirst So I came in here And your long-time curse hurts But what’s worse Is this pain in here I can’t stay in here Ain’t it clear that— I just can’t fit Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit When we meet again Introduced as friends Please don’t let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do You make love just like a woman, yes, you do Then you ache just like a woman But you break just like a little girl Summer days, summer nights are gone Summer days and the summer nights are gone I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out lying in the mud Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood Everybody get ready—lift your glasses and sing Everybody get ready to lift your glasses and sing Well, I’m standin’ on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the King Well I’m drivin’ in the flats in a Cadillac car The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star” My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?

Wedding bells ringin’, the choir is beginning to sing Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing What looks good in the day, at night is another thing She’s looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand She’s looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand She says, “You can’t repeat the past.” I say, “You can’t? What do you mean, you can’t? Of course you can.” Where do you come from? Where do you go? Sorry that’s nothin’ you would need to know Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall My dogs are barking, there must be someone around My dogs are barking, there must be someone around I got my hammer ringin’, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t goin’ down You got something to say, speak or hold your peace Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace If it’s information you want you can go get it from the police Politician got on his jogging shoes He must be running for office, got no time to lose He been suckin’ the blood out of the genius of generosity You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginnin’ to shake Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginnin’ to shake I’m countin’ on you love, to give me a break Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift Gonna break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift Summer days, summer nights are gone Summer days, summer nights are gone I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on A worried man with a worried mind No one in front of me and nothing behind There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose People are crazy and times are strange I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range I used to care, but things have changed This place ain’t doing me any good I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood Just for a second there I thought I saw something move Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through People are crazy and times are strange I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range I used to care, but things have changed I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road If the Bible is right, the world will explode I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can Some things are too hot to touch The human mind can only stand so much You can’t win with a losing hand Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street People are crazy and times are strange I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range I used to care, but things have changed I hurt easy, I just don’t show it You can hurt someone and not even know it The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity Gonna get low down, gonna fly high All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake I’m not that eager to make a mistake People are crazy and times are strange I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range I used to care, but things have changed Darkness at the break of noon Shadows even the silver spoon The handmade blade, the child’s balloon Eclipses both the sun and moon To understand you know too soon There is no sense in trying Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn Suicide remarks are torn From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn Plays wasted words, proves to warn That he not busy being born is busy dying Temptation’s page flies out the door You follow, find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar You feel to moan but unlike before You discover that you’d just be one more Person crying So don’t fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing As some warn victory, some downfall Private reasons great or small Can be seen in the eyes of those that call To make all that should be killed to crawl While others say don’t hate nothing at all Except hatred Disillusioned words like bullets bark As human gods aim for their mark Make everything from toy guns that spark To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark It’s easy to see without looking too far That not much is really sacred While preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the president of the United States Sometimes must have to stand naked An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it Advertising signs they con You into thinking you’re the one That can do what’s never been done That can win what’s never been won Meantime life outside goes on All around you You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks they really found you A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit To satisfy, insure you not to quit To keep it in your mind and not forget That it is not he or she or them or it That you belong to Although the masters make the rules For the wise men and the fools I got nothing, Ma, to live up to For them that must obey authority That they do not respect in any degree Who despise their jobs, their destinies Speak jealously of them that are free Cultivate their flowers to be Nothing more than something they invest in While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise Outsiders they can freely criticize Tell nothing except who to idolize And then say God bless him While one who sings with his tongue on fire Gargles in the rat race choir Bent out of shape from society’s pliers Cares not to come up any higher But rather get you down in the hole That he’s in But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him Old lady judges watch people in pairs Limited in sex, they dare To push fake morals, insult and stare While money doesn’t talk, it swears Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony While them that defend what they cannot see With a killer’s pride, security It blows the minds most bitterly For them that think death’s honesty Won’t fall upon them naturally Life sometimes must get lonely My eyes collide head-on with stuffed Graveyards, false gods, I scuff At pettiness which plays so rough Walk upside-down inside handcuffs Kick my legs to crash it off Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me? And if my thought-dreams could be seen They’d probably put my head in a guillotine But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only I’m walking through streets that are dead Walking, walking with you in my head My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired And the clouds are weeping Did I hear someone tell a lie? Did I hear someone’s distant cry? I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile While I was sleeping I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it This kind of love I’m so sick of it I see, I see lovers in the meadow I see, I see silhouettes in the window I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on To a shadow I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick This kind of love; I’m love sick Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under Could you ever be true? I think of you And I wonder I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you Just don’t know what to do I’d give anything to be with you Oh, the ragman draws circles Up and down the block I’d ask him what the matter was But I know that he don’t talk And the ladies treat me kindly And furnish me with tape But deep inside my heart I know I can’t escape Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley With his pointed shoes and his bells Speaking to some French girl Who says she knows me well And I would send a message To find out if she’s talked But the post office has been stolen And the mailbox is locked Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Mona tried to tell me To stay away from the train line She said that all the railroad men Just drink up your blood like wine An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that But then again, there’s only one I’ve met An’ he just smoked my eyelids An’ punched my cigarette” Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Grandpa died last week And now he’s buried in the rocks But everybody still talks about How badly they were shocked But me, I expected it to happen I knew he’d lost control When he built a fire on Main Street And shot it full of holes Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Now the senator came down here Showing ev’ryone his gun Handing out free tickets To the wedding of his son An’ me, I nearly got busted An’ wouldn’t it be my luck To get caught without a ticket And be discovered beneath a truck Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Now the preacher looked so baffled When I asked him why he dressed With twenty pounds of headlines Stapled to his chest But he cursed me when I proved it to him Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide You see, you’re just like me I hope you’re satisfied” Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Now the rainman gave me two cures Then he said, “Jump right in” The one was Texas medicine The other was just railroad gin An’ like a fool I mixed them An’ it strangled up my mind An’ now people just get uglier An’ I have no sense of time Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again When Ruthie says come see her In her honky-tonk lagoon Where I can watch her waltz for free ’Neath her Panamanian moon An’ I say, “Aw come on now You must know about my debutante” An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need But I know what you want” Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again Now the bricks lay on Grand Street Where the neon madmen climb They all fall there so perfectly It all seems so well timed An’ here I sit so patiently Waiting to find out what price You have to pay to get out of Going through all these things twice Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again High water risin’—risin’ night and day All the gold and silver are bein\\' stolen away Big Joe Turner lookin’ east and west From the dark room of his mind

alive Either one, I don’t care” High water everywhere The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies I’m preachin’ the Word of God I’m puttin’ out your eyes I asked Fat Nancy for somethin\\' to eat, she said, “Take it off the shelf— As great as you are a man You’ll never be greater than yourself” I told her I didn’t really care High water everywhere I’m gettin’ up in the morning—I believe I’ll dust my broom Keeping away from the women I’m givin’ ’em lots of room Thunder rolling over Clarkesdale, everything is looking blue I just can’t be happy, love Unless you’re happy too It’s bad out there High water everywhere They sat together in the park As the evening sky grew dark She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones ’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate They walked along by the old canal A little confused, I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate A saxophone someplace far off played As she was walkin’ by the arcade As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up, She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate He woke up, the room was bare He didn’t see her anywhere He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait Once more for a simple twist of fate People tell me it’s a sin To know and feel too much within I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring She was born in spring, but I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate Come gather ’round people Wherever you roam And admit that the waters Around you have grown And accept it that soon You’ll be drenched to the bone If your time to you is worth savin’ Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a

mothers and fathers Throughout the land And don’t criticize What you can’t understand Your sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is rapidly agin’ Please get out of the new one

fadin’ And the first one now will later be last For the times they are a-changin’ Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps Some of these women they just give me the creeps I’m avoidin’ the

the matter with me I don’t have much to say Daylight sneakin’ through the window And I’m still in this all-night café Walkin’ to and fro beneath the moon Out to where the trucks are rollin’ slow To sit down on this bank of sand And watch the river flow Wish I was back in the city Instead of this old bank of sand With the sun beating down over the chimney tops And the one I love so close at hand If I had wings and I could fly I know where I would go But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly And watch the river flow People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah Makes you stop and all wonder why Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street Who just couldn’t help but cry Oh, this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow And as long as it does I’ll just sit here And watch the river flow People disagreeing everywhere you look Makes you wanna stop and read a book Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street That was really shook But this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow And as long as it does I’ll just sit here And watch the river flow Watch the river flow Watchin’ the river flow Watchin’ the river flow But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand And watch the river flow May God bless and keep you always May your wishes all come true May you always do for others And let others do for you May you build a ladder to the stars And climb on every rung May you stay forever young Forever young, forever young May you stay forever young May you grow up to be righteous May you grow up to be true May you always know the truth And see the lights surrounding you May you always be courageous Stand upright and be strong May you stay forever young Forever young, forever young May you stay forever young May your hands always be busy May your feet always be swift May you have a strong foundation When the winds of changes shift May your heart always be joyful May your song always be sung May you stay forever young Forever young, forever young May you stay forever young She’s got everything she needs She’s an artist, she don’t look back

They’re throwing knives into the tree Two big bags of dead man’s bones Got their noses to the grindstones Living in the Land of Nod Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God They pass by so silently Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire They’re taking a street car named Desire Looking in the window at the pecan pie Lot of things they’d like they would never buy Neither one gonna turn and run They’re making a voyage to the sun “His Master’s voice is calling me” Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum All that and more and then some They walk among the stately trees They know the secrets of the breeze Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee “Your presence is obnoxious to me” They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee Well, the rain beating down on my window pane I got love for you and it’s all in vain Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please” “What’s good for you is good for me” Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee

look out tonight From Desolation Row Cinderella, she seems so easy “It takes one to know one,” she smiles And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning “You Belong to Me I Believe” And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend You better leave” And the only sound that’s left After the ambulances go Is Cinderella sweeping up On Desolation Row Now the moon is almost hidden The stars are beginning to hide The fortune-telling lady Has even taken all her things inside All except for Cain and Abel And the hunchback of Notre Dame Everybody is making love Or else expecting rain And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing He’s getting ready for the show He’s going to the carnival tonight On Desolation Row Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window For her I feel so afraid On her twenty-second birthday She already is an old maid To her, death is quite romantic She wears an iron vest Her profession’s her religion Her sin is her lifelessness And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah’s great rainbow She spends her time peeking Into Desolation Row Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood With his memories in a trunk Passed this way an hour ago With his friend, a jealous monk He looked so immaculately frightful As he bummed a cigarette Then he went off sniffing drainpipes And reciting the alphabet Now you would not think to look at him But he was famous long ago For playing the electric violin On Desolation Row Dr. Filth, he keeps his world Inside of a leather cup But all his sexless patients They’re trying to blow it up Now his nurse, some local loser She’s in charge of the cyanide hole And she also keeps the cards that read “Have Mercy on His Soul” They all play on pennywhistles You can hear them blow If you lean your head out far enough From Desolation Row Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains They’re getting ready for the feast The Phantom of the Opera A perfect image of a priest They’re spoonfeeding Casanova To get him to feel more assured Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence After poisoning him with words And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know Casanova is just being punished for going To Desolation Row” Now at midnight all the agents And the superhuman crew Come out and round up everyone That knows more than they do Then they bring them to the factory Where the heart-attack machine Is strapped across their shoulders And then the kerosene Is brought down from the castles By insurance men who go Check to see that nobody is escaping To Desolation Row Praise be to Nero’s Neptune The Titanic sails at dawn And everybody’s shouting “Which Side Are You On?” And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot Fighting in the captain’s tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers Between the windows of the sea Where lovely mermaids flow And nobody has to think too much About Desolation Row Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the doorknob broke) When you asked how I was doing Was that some kind of joke? All these people that you mention Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame I had to rearrange their faces And give them all another name Right now I can’t read too good Don’t send me no more letters, no Not unless you mail them From Desolation Row Mama, take this badge off of me I can’t use it anymore It’s gettin’ dark, too dark for me to see I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Mama, put my guns in the ground I can’t shoot them anymore That long black cloud is comin’ down I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? Oh, where have you been, my darling young one? I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’ I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’ I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’ Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’ Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’ Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’ Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son? Who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman whose body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded with hatred And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one? I’m a-goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’ I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’ But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’ And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall Close your eyes, close the door You don’t have to worry anymore I’ll be your baby tonight Shut the light, shut the shade You don’t have to be afraid I’ll be your baby tonight Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away We’re gonna forget it That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon But we’re gonna let it You won’t regret it Kick your shoes off, do not fear Bring that bottle over here I’ll be your baby tonight I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown I went to church on Sunday and she passed by My love for her is taking such a long time to die I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound The walls of pride are high and wide Can’t see over to the other side It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away One look at you and I’m out of control Like the universe has swallowed me whole I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound There’s too many people, too many to recall I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood I found my world, found my world in you But your love just hasn’t proved true I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds Reality has always had too many heads Some things last longer than you think they will There are some kind of things you can never kill It’s you and you only I been thinking about But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank I

the night is still ahead I love you pretty baby You\\'re the only love I\\'ve ever known Just as long as you stay with me The whole world is my throne Beyond here lies nothin\\' Nothin\\' we can call our own I\\'m movin\\' after midnight Down boulevards of broken cars Don\\'t know what to do without it Without this love that we call ours Beyond here lies nothin\\' Nothin\\' but the moon and stars Down every street there\\'s a window And every window made of glass We\\'ll keep on lovin\\' pretty baby For as long as love will last Beyond here lies nothin\\' But the mountains of the past My ship is in the harbor And the sails are spread Listen to me pretty baby Lay your hand upon my head Beyond here lies nothin\\' Nothin\\' done and nothin\\' said ’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved Everything up to that point had been left unresolved Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born “Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm” Ramona Come closer Shut softly your watery eyes The pangs of your sadness Shall pass as your senses will rise The flowers of the city Though breathlike Get deathlike at times And there’s no use in tryin’ T’ deal with the dyin’ Though I cannot explain that in lines Your cracked country lips I still wish to kiss As to be under the strength of your skin Your magnetic movements Still capture the minutes I’m in But it grieves my heart, love To see you tryin’ to be a part of A world that just don’t exist It’s all just a dream, babe A vacuum, a scheme, babe That sucks you into feelin’ like this I can see that your head Has been twisted and fed By worthless foam from the mouth I can tell you are torn Between stayin’ and returnin’ On back to the South You’ve been fooled into thinking That the finishin’ end is at hand Yet there’s no one to beat you No one t’ defeat you ’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad I’ve heard you say many times That you’re better ’n no one And no one is better ’n you If you really believe that You know you got Nothing to win and nothing to lose From fixtures and forces and friends Your sorrow does stem That hype you and type you Making you feel That you must be exactly like them I’d forever talk to you But soon my words They would turn into a meaningless ring For deep in my heart I know there is no help I can bring Everything passes Everything changes Just do what you think you should do And someday maybe Who knows, baby I’ll come and be cryin’ to you My love she speaks like silence Without ideals or violence She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire People carry roses Make promises by the hours My love she laughs like the flowers Valentines can’t buy her In the dime stores and bus stations People talk of situations Read books, repeat quotations Draw conclusions on the wall Some speak of the future My love she speaks softly She knows there’s no success like failure And that failure’s no success at all The cloak and dagger dangles Madams light the candles In ceremonies of the horsemen Even the pawn must hold a grudge Statues made of matchsticks Crumble into one another My love winks, she does not bother She knows too much to argue or to judge The bridge at midnight trembles The country doctor rambles Bankers’ nieces seek perfection Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring The wind howls like a hammer The night blows cold and rainy My love she’s like some raven At my window with a broken wing You got a lotta nerve To say you are my friend When I was down You just stood there grinning You got a lotta nerve To say you got a helping hand to lend You just want to be on The side that’s winning You say I let you down You know it’s not like that If you’re so hurt Why then don’t you show it You say you lost your faith But that’s not where it’s at You had no faith to lose And you know it I know the reason That you talk behind my back I used to be among the crowd You’re in with Do you take me for such a fool To think I’d make contact With the one who tries to hide What he don’t know to begin with You see me on the street You always act surprised You say, “How are you?” “Good luck” But you don’t mean it When you know as well as me You’d rather see me paralyzed Why don’t you just come out once And scream it No, I do not feel that good When I see the heartbreaks you embrace If I was a master thief Perhaps I’d rob them And now I know you’re dissatisfied With your position and your place Don’t you understand It’s not my problem I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes And just for that one moment I could be you Yes, I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes You’d know what a drag it is To see you I can’t understand She let go of my hand An’ left me here facing the wall I’d sure like t’ know Why she did go But I can’t get close t’ her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime She said she would never forget But now mornin’s clear It’s like I ain’t here She just acts like we never have met It’s all new t’ me Like some mystery It could even be like a myth Yet it’s hard t’ think on That she’s the same one That last night I was with From darkness, dreams’re deserted Am I still dreamin’ yet? I wish she’d unlock Her voice once an’ talk ’Stead of acting like we never have met If she ain’t feelin’ well Then why don’t she tell ’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face? Without any doubt She seems too far out For me t’ return t’ her chase Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling I remember her whispering yet But evidently she don’t An’ evidently she won’t She just acts like we never have met If I didn’t have t’ guess I’d gladly confess T’ anything I might’ve tried If I was with ’er too long Or have done something wrong I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played Her mouth was watery and wet But now something has changed For she ain’t the same She just acts like we never have met I’m leavin’ today I’ll be on my way Of this I can’t say very much But if you want me to I can be just like you An’ pretend that we never have touched An’ if anybody asks me “Is it easy to forget?” I’ll say, “It’s easily done You just pick anyone An’ pretend that you never have met!” When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?

No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’ Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled From across that lonesome ocean Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine Made of silver or of golden Either from the mountains of Madrid Or from the coast of Barcelona Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night And the diamonds from the deepest ocean I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’ That I might be gone a long time And it’s only that I’m askin’ Is there something I can send you to remember me by To make your time more easy passin’ Oh, how can, how can you ask me again It only brings me sorrow The same thing I want from you today I would want again tomorrow I got a letter on a lonesome day It was from her ship a-sailin’ Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again It depends on how I’m a-feelin’ Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way I’m sure your mind is roamin’ I’m sure your heart is not with me But with the country to where you’re goin’ So take heed, take heed of the western wind Take heed of the stormy weather And yes, there’s something you can send back to me Spanish boots of Spanish leather William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger At a Baltimore hotel society gath’rin’ And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him As they rode him in custody down to the station And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears Take the rag away from your face Now ain’t the time for your tears William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him And high office relations in the politics of Maryland Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears Take the rag away from your face Now ain’t the time for your tears Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage And never sat once at the head of the table And didn’t even talk to the people at the table Who just cleaned up all the food from the table And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane That sailed through the air and came down through the room Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears Take the rag away from your face Now ain’t the time for your tears In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded And that even the nobles get properly handled Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom Stared at the person who killed for no reason Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’ And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears Bury the rag deep in your face For now’s the time for your tears Crickets are chirpin’, the water is high There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry Window wide open, African trees Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze Not a word of goodbye, not even a note She gone with the man In the long black coat Somebody seen him hanging around At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote There was dust on the man In the long black coat Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved You cannot depend on it to be your guide When it’s you who must keep it satisfied It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat She gave her heart to the man In the long black coat There are no mistakes in life some people say It is true sometimes you can see it that way But people don\\'t live or die, people just float She went with the man In the long black coat There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June Tree trunks uprooted, \\'neath the high crescent moon Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force Somebody is out there beating a dead horse She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote She gone with the man In the long black coat Broken lines, broken strings Broken threads, broken springs Broken idols, broken heads People sleeping in broken beds Ain’t no use jiving Ain’t no use joking Everything is broken Broken bottles, broken plates Broken switches, broken gates Broken dishes, broken parts Streets are filled with broken hearts Broken words never meant to be spoken Everything is broken Seem like every time you stop and turn around Something else just hit the ground Broken cutters, broken saws Broken buckles, broken laws Broken bodies, broken bones Broken voices on broken phones Take a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin\\' Everything is broken Every time you leave and go off someplace Things fall to pieces in my face Broken hands on broken ploughs Broken treaties, broken vows Broken pipes, broken tools People bending broken rules Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking Everything is broken There\\'s an evenin\\' haze settlin\\' over the town Starlight by the edge of the creek The buyin\\' power of the proletariat\\'s gone down Money\\'s gettin\\' shallow and weak The place I love best is a sweet memory It\\'s a new path that we trod They say low wages are a reality If we want to compete abroad My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf Come sit down on my knee You are dearer to me than myself As you yourself can see I\\'m listenin\\' to the steel rails hum Got both eyes tight shut Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from Creeping it\\'s way into my gut Meet me at the bottom, don\\'t lag behind Bring me my boots and shoes You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman\\'s blues Now, I\\'m sailin\\' on back, ready for the long haul Tossed by the winds and the seas I\\'ll drag ‘em all down to hell and I\\'ll stand ‘em at the wall I\\'ll sell ‘em to their enemies I\\'m tryin\\' to feed my soul with thought Gonna sleep off the rest of the day Sometimes no one wants what we got Sometimes you can\\'t give it away Now the place is ringed with countless foes Some of them may be deaf and dumb No man, no woman knows The hour that sorrow will come In the dark I hear the night birds call I can hear a lover\\'s breath I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall Sleep is like a temporary death Meet me at the bottom, don\\'t lag behind Bring me my boots and shoes You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman\\'s blues Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse I can\\'t save a dime I got to be careful, I don\\'t want to be forced Into a life of continual crime I can see for myself that the sun is sinking How I wish you were here to see Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking That you have forgotten me? Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret They waste your nights and days Them I will forget But you I\\'ll remember always Old memories of you to me have clung You\\'ve wounded me with words Gonna have to straighten out your tongue It\\'s all true, everything you have heard Meet me at the bottom, don\\'t lag behind Bring me my boots and shoes You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman\\'s blues In you, my friend, I find no blame Wanna look in my eyes, please do No one can ever claim That I took up arms against you All across the peaceful sacred fields They will lay you low They\\'ll break your horns and slash you with steel I say it so it must be so Now I\\'m down on my luck and I\\'m black and blue Gonna give you another chance I\\'m all alone and I\\'m expecting you To lead me off in a cheerful dance Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife I can live on rice and beans Some people never worked a day in their life Don\\'t know what work even means Meet me at the bottom, don\\'t lag behind Bring me my boots and shoes You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman\\'s blues Señor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’? Lincoln County Road or Armageddon? Seems like I been down this way before Is there any truth in that, señor? Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’? How long are we gonna be ridin’? How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door? Will there be any comfort there, señor? There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck There’s an iron cross still hangin\\' down from around her neck There’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot Where she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not” Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon I can smell the tail of the dragon Can’t stand the suspense anymore Can you tell me who to contact here, señor? Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring Said, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing” Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather Well, give me a minute, let me get it together I just gotta pick myself up off the floor I’m ready when you are, señor Señor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables Overturn these tables This place don’t make sense to me no more Can you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor? Crimson flames tied through my ears Rollin’ high and mighty traps Pounced with fire on flaming roads Using ideas as my maps “We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I Proud ’neath heated brow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth “Rip down all hate,” I screamed Lies that life is black and white Spoke from my skull. I dreamed Romantic facts of musketeers Foundationed deep, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now Girls’ faces formed the forward path From phony jealousy To memorizing politics Of ancient history Flung down by corpse evangelists Unthought of, though, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now A self-ordained professor’s tongue Too serious to fool Spouted out that liberty Is just equality in school “Equality,” I spoke the word As if a wedding vow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand At the mongrel dogs who teach Fearing not that I’d become my enemy In the instant that I preach My pathway led by confusion boats Mutiny from stern to bow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats Too noble to neglect Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect Good and bad, I define these terms Quite clear, no doubt, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I’m younger than that now They ask me how I feel And if my love is real And how I know I’ll make it through And they, they look at me and frown They’d like to drive me from this town They don’t want me around ’Cause I believe in you They show me to the door They say don’t come back no more ’Cause I don’t be like they’d like me to And I walk out on my own A thousand miles from home But I don’t feel alone ’Cause I believe in you I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter I believe in you even though we be apart I believe in you even on the morning after Oh, when the dawn is nearing Oh, when the night is disappearing Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart Don’t let me drift too far Keep me where you are Where I will always be renewed And that which you’ve given me today Is worth more than I could pay And no matter what they say I believe in you I believe in you when winter turn to summer I believe in you when white turn to black I believe in you even though I be outnumbered Oh, though the earth may shake me Oh, though my friends forsake me Oh, even that couldn’t make me go back Don’t let me change my heart Keep me set apart From all the plans they do pursue And I, I don’t mind the pain Don’t mind the driving rain I know I will sustain ’Cause I believe in you “Oh, help me in my weakness” I heard the drifter say As they carried him from the courtroom And were taking him away “My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one And my time it isn’t long And I still do not know What it was that I’ve done wrong” Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside A tear came to his eye “You fail to understand,” he said “Why must you even try?” Outside, the crowd was stirring You could hear it from the door Inside, the judge was stepping down While the jury cried for more “Oh, stop that cursed jury” Cried the attendant and the nurse “The trial was bad enough But this is ten times worse” Just then a bolt of lightning Struck the courthouse out of shape And while ev’rybody knelt to pray The drifter did escape When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez And it’s Eastertime too And your gravity fails And negativity don’t pull you through Don’t put on any airs When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue They got some hungry women there And they really make a mess outta you Now if you see Saint Annie Please tell her thanks a lot I cannot move My fingers are all in a knot I don’t have the strength To get up and take another shot And my best friend, my doctor Won’t even say what it is I’ve got Sweet Melinda The peasants call her the goddess of gloom She speaks good English And she invites you up into her room And you’re so kind And careful not to go to her too soon And she takes your voice And leaves you howling at the moon Up on Housing Project Hill It’s either fortune or fame You must pick up one or the other Though neither of them are to be what they claim If you’re lookin’ to get silly You better go back to from where you came Because the cops don’t need you And man they expect the same Now all the authorities They just stand around and boast How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms Into leaving his post And picking up Angel who Just arrived here from the coast Who looked so fine at first But left looking just like a ghost I started out on burgundy But soon hit the harder stuff Everybody said they’d stand behind me When the game got rough But the joke was on me There was nobody even there to call my bluff I’m going back to New York City I do believe I’ve had enough Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down But it looks like it don’t I’d like to get you to change your mind But it looks like you won’t From now on I’ll be busy Ain’t goin’ nowhere fast I’m just glad it’s over And I’m seeing the real you at last Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you Didn’t I take chances? Didn’t I rise above it all for you The most unfortunate circumstances? Well, I have had some rotten nights Didn’t think that they would pass I’m just thankful and grateful To be seeing the real you at last I’m hungry and I’m irritable And I’m tired of this bag of tricks At one time there was nothing wrong with me That you could not fix Well, I sailed through the storm Strapped to the mast But the time has come And I’m seeing the real you at last When I met you, baby You didn’t show no visible scars You could ride like Annie Oakley You could shoot like Belle Starr Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble Trouble always comes to pass But all I care about now Is that I’m seeing the real you at last Well, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now I guess I should have known I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone Whatever you gonna do Please do it fast I’m still trying to get used to Seeing the real you at last What good am I if I’m like all the rest If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry What good am I? What good am I if I know and don’t do If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky What good am I? What good am I while you softly weep And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try What good am I? What good am I then to others and me If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see If my hands are tied must I not wonder within Who tied them and why and where must I have been? What good am I if I say foolish things And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings And I just turn my back while you silently die What good am I? Down the street the dogs are barkin’ And the day is a-gettin’ dark As the night comes in a-fallin’ The dogs’ll lose their bark An’ the silent night will shatter From the sounds inside my mind For I’m one too many mornings And a thousand miles behind From the crossroads of my doorstep My eyes they start to fade As I turn my head back to the room Where my love and I have laid An’ I gaze back to the street The sidewalk and the sign And I’m one too many mornings An’ a thousand miles behind It’s a restless hungry feeling That don’t mean no one no good When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’ You can say it just as good. You’re right from your side I’m right from mine We’re both just one too many mornings An’ a thousand miles behind Forgetful heart Lost your power of recall Every little detail You don\\'t remember at all The times we knew Who would remember better then you Forgetful heart We laughed and had a good time you and I It\\'s been so long Now you\\'re content to let the days go by When you were there You were the answer to my prayer Forgetful heart We loved with all the love that life can give What can I say Without you it\\'s so hard to live Can\\'t take much more Why can\\'t we love like we did before Forgetful heart Like a walking shadow in my brain All night long I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain The door has closed forevermore If indeed there ever was a door I’ll remember you When I’ve forgotten all the rest You to me were true You to me were the best When there is no more You cut to the core Quicker than anyone I knew When I’m all alone In the great unknown I’ll remember you I’ll remember you At the end of the trail I had so much left to do I had so little time to fail There’s some people that You don’t forget Even though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two When the roses fade And I’m in the shade I’ll remember you Didn’t I, didn’t I try to love you? Didn’t I, didn’t I try to care? Didn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you With the rain blowing in your hair? I’ll remember you When the wind blows through the piney wood It was you who came right through It was you who understood Though I’d never say That I done it the way That you’d have liked me to In the end My dear sweet friend I’ll remember you Seen the arrow on the doorpost Saying, “This land is condemned All the way from New Orleans To Jerusalem” I traveled through East Texas Where many martyrs fell And I know no one can sing the blues Like Blind Willie McTell Well, I heard that hoot owl singing As they were taking down the tents The stars above the barren trees Were his only audience Them charcoal gypsy maidens Can strut their feathers well But nobody can sing the blues Like Blind Willie McTell See them big plantations burning Hear the cracking of the whips Smell that sweet magnolia blooming See the ghosts of slavery ships I can hear them tribes a-moaning Hear that undertaker’s bell Nobody can sing the blues Like Blind Willie McTell There’s a woman by the river With some fine young handsome man He’s dressed up like a squire Bootlegged whiskey in his hand There’s a chain gang on the highway I can hear them rebels yell And I know no one can sing the blues Like Blind Willie McTell Well, God is in His heaven And we all want what’s his But power and greed and corruptible seed Seem to be all that there is I’m gazing out the window Of the St. James Hotel And I know no one can sing the blues Like Blind Willie McTell Of war and peace the truth just twists Its curfew gull just glides Upon four-legged forest clouds The cowboy angel rides With his candle lit into the sun Though its glow is waxed in black All except when ’neath the trees of Eden The lamppost stands with folded arms Its iron claws attached To curbs ’neath holes where babies wail Though it shadows metal badge All and all can only fall With a crashing but meaningless blow No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden The savage soldier sticks his head in sand And then complains Unto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deaf But still remains Upon the beach where hound dogs bay At ships with tattooed sails Heading for the Gates of Eden With a time-rusted compass blade Aladdin and his lamp Sits with Utopian hermit monks Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf And on their promises of paradise You will not hear a laugh All except inside the Gates of Eden Relationships of ownership They whisper in the wings To those condemned to act accordingly And wait for succeeding kings And I try to harmonize with songs The lonesome sparrow sings There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden The motorcycle black madonna Two-wheeled gypsy queen And her silver-studded phantom cause The gray flannel dwarf to scream As he weeps to wicked birds of prey Who pick up on his bread crumb sins And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden The kingdoms of Experience In the precious wind they rot While paupers change possessions Each one wishing for what the other has got And the princess and the prince Discuss what’s real and what is not It doesn’t matter inside the Gates of Eden The foreign sun, it squints upon A bed that is never mine As friends and other strangers From their fates try to resign Leaving men wholly, totally free To do anything they wish to do but die And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden At dawn my lover comes to me And tells me of her dreams With no attempts to shovel the glimpse Into the ditch of what each one means At times I think there are no words But these to tell what’s true And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin\\' to be so quiet? We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft In this room the heat pipes just cough The country music station plays soft But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise and her lover so entwined And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near She’s delicate and seems like the mirror But she just makes it all too concise and too clear That Johanna’s not here The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall How can I explain? Oh, it’s so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze I can’t find my knees” Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him” But like Louise always says “Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?” As she, herself, prepares for him And Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain The guilty undertaker sighs The lonesome organ grinder cries The silver saxophones say I should refuse you The cracked bells and washed-out horns Blow into my face with scorn But it’s not that way I wasn’t born to lose you I want you, I want you I want you so bad Honey, I want you The drunken politician leaps Upon the street where mothers weep And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you And I wait for them to interrupt Me drinkin’ from my broken cup And ask me to Open up the gate for you I want you, I want you I want you so bad Honey, I want you How all my fathers, they’ve gone down True love they’ve been without it But all their daughters put me down ’Cause I don’t think about it Well, I return to the Queen of Spades And talk with my chambermaid She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her She is good to me And there’s nothing she doesn’t see She knows where I’d like to be But it doesn’t matter I want you, I want you I want you so bad Honey, I want you Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit He spoke to me, I took his flute No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I? But I did it, though, because he lied Because he took you for a ride And because time was on his side And because I . . . I want you, I want you I want you so bad Honey, I want you Our conversation was short and sweet It nearly swept me off-a my feet And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh And you are on dry land You made it there somehow You’re a big girl now Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh Singin’ just for you I hope that you can hear Hear me singin’ through these tears Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last I can change, I swear, oh, oh See what you can do I can make it through You can make it too Love is so simple, to quote a phrase You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh In somebody’s room It’s a price I have to pay You’re a big girl all the way A change in the weather is known to be extreme But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream? I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh With a pain that stops and starts Like a corkscrew to my heart Ever since we’ve been apart Hollis Brown He lived on the outside of town Hollis Brown He lived on the outside of town With his wife and five children And his cabin fallin’ down You looked for work and money And you walked a rugged mile You looked for work and money And you walked a rugged mile Your children are so hungry That they don’t know how to smile Your baby’s eyes look crazy They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve Your baby’s eyes look crazy They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve You walk the floor and wonder why With every breath you breathe The rats have got your flour Bad blood it got your mare The rats have got your flour Bad blood it got your mare If there’s anyone that knows Is there anyone that cares? You prayed to the Lord above Oh please send you a friend You prayed to the Lord above Oh please send you a friend Your empty pockets tell yuh That you ain’t a-got no friend Your babies are crying louder It’s pounding on your brain Your babies are crying louder now It’s pounding on your brain Your wife’s screams are stabbin’ you Like the dirty drivin’ rain Your grass it is turning black There’s no water in your well Your grass is turning black There’s no water in your well You spent your last lone dollar On seven shotgun shells Way out in the wilderness A cold coyote calls Way out in the wilderness A cold coyote calls Your eyes fix on the shotgun That’s hangin’ on the wall Your brain is a-bleedin’ And your legs can’t seem to stand Your brain is a-bleedin’ And your legs can’t seem to stand Your eyes fix on the shotgun That you’re holdin’ in your hand There’s seven breezes a-blowin’ All around the cabin door There’s seven breezes a-blowin’ All around the cabin door Seven shots ring out Like the ocean’s pounding roar There’s seven people dead On a South Dakota farm There’s seven people dead On a South Dakota farm Somewhere in the distance There’s seven new people born Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams I and I In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives I and I One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives Think I’ll go out and go for a walk Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk I got nothin’ to say, ’specially about whatever was I and I In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives I and I One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth I and I In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives I and I One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back I and I In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives I and I One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot I and I In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives I and I One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives Perhaps it’s the color of the sun cut flat An’ cov’rin’ the crossroads I’m standing at Or maybe it’s the weather or something like that But mama, you been on my mind I don’t mean trouble, please don’t put me down or get upset I am not pleadin’ or sayin’, “I can’t forget” I do not walk the floor bowed down an’ bent, but yet Mama, you been on my mind Even though my mind is hazy an’ my thoughts they might be narrow Where you been don’t bother me nor bring me down in sorrow It don’t even matter to me where you’re wakin’ up tomorrow But mama, you’re just on my mind I am not askin’ you to say words like “yes” or “no” Please understand me, I got no place for you t’ go I’m just breathin’ to myself, pretendin’ not that I don’t know Mama, you been on my mind When you wake up in the mornin’, baby, look inside your mirror You know I won’t be next to you, you know I won’t be near I’d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear As someone who has had you on his mind When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven’t made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong I’ve known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue I’d go crawling down the avenue There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rollin’ sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain’t seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true Nothing that I wouldn’t do Go to the ends of the earth for you To make you feel my love Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much Nothing can heal me now, but your touch I don’t know what I’m gonna do I was all right ’til I fell in love with you Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do I was all right ’til I fell in love with you Boys in the street beginning to play Girls like birds flying away When I’m gone you will remember my name I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame I don’t know what I’m gonna do I was all right ’til I fell in love with you Junk is piling up, taking up space My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more I don’t know what I’m gonna do I was all right ’til I fell in love with you Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain My attempts to please you were all in vain Tomorrow night before the sun goes down If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound I just don’t know what I’m gonna do I was all right ’til I fell in love with you God knows you ain’t pretty God knows it’s true God knows there ain’t anybody Ever gonna take the place of you God knows it’s a struggle God knows it’s a crime God knows there’s gonna be no more water But fire next time God don’t call it treason God don’t call it wrong It was supposed to last a season But it’s been so strong for so long God knows it’s fragile God knows everything God knows it could snap apart right now Just like putting scissors to a string God knows it’s terrifying God sees it all unfold There’s a million reasons for you to be crying You been so bold and so cold God knows that when you see it God knows you’ve got to weep God knows the secrets of your heart He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep God knows there’s a river God knows how to make it flow God knows you ain’t gonna be taking Nothing with you when you go God knows there’s a purpose God knows there’s a chance God knows you can rise above the darkest hour Of any circumstance God knows there’s a heaven God knows it’s out of sight God knows we can get all the way from here to there Even if we’ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around Some on their way up, some on their way down The air burns and I’m trying to think straight And I don’t know how much longer I can wait I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate But I don’t know how much longer I can wait Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true That’s how it is when things disintegrate And I don’t know how much longer I can wait I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate But I don’t know how much longer I can wait In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame And every time I pass that way I always hear my name Then onward in my journey I come to understand That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it Sometimes it gets so hard, you see I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet With all these promises you left for me But where are you tonight, sweet Marie? Well, I waited for you when I was half sick Yes, I waited for you when you hated me Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic When you knew I had some other place to be Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie? Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately Well, six white horses that you did promise Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary But to live outside the law, you must be honest I know you always say that you agree But where are you tonight, sweet Marie? Well, I don’t know how it happened But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate But ev’rybody else, even yourself They’re just gonna have to wait Well, I got the fever down in my pockets The Persian drunkard, he follows me Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it You see, you forgot to leave me with the key Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie? Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed That a man can’t give his address out to bad company And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad In the ruins of your balcony Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie Crash on the levee, mama Water\\'s gonna overflow Swamp\\'s gonna rise No boat\\'s gonna row Now, you can train on down To Williams Point You can bust your feet You can rock this joint But oh mama, ain\\'t you gonna miss your best friend now? You\\'re gonna have to find yourself Another best friend, somehow Now, don\\'t you try an\\' move me You\\'re just gonna lose There\\'s a crash on the levee And, mama, you\\'ve been refused Well, it\\'s sugar for sugar And salt for salt If you go down in the flood It\\'s gonna be your own fault Oh mama, ain\\'t you gonna miss your best friend now? You\\'re gonna have to find yourself Another best friend, somehow Well, that high tide\\'s risin\\' Mama, don\\'t you let me down Pack up your suitcase Mama, don\\'t you make a sound Now, it\\'s king for king Queen for queen It\\'s gonna be the meanest flood That anybody\\'s seen Oh mama, ain\\'t you gonna miss your best friend now? Yes, you\\'re gonna have to find yourself Another best friend, somehow John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore His mama sure was proud of him! He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all His mama’s face broke out all in a grin “Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine You make me proud to know you hold a gun Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home” As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood: “That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know” She made well sure her neighbors understood She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile As she showed them to the people from next door And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun And these things you called a good old-fashioned war Oh! Good old-fashioned war! Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come They ceased to come for about ten months or more Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train Your son’s a-coming home from the war” She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around But she could not see her soldier son in sight But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last When she did she could hardly believe her eyes Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off And he wore a metal brace around his waist He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know While she couldn’t even recognize his face! Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face “Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done How is it you come to be this way?” He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move And the mother had to turn her face away “Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war You thought it was the best thing I could do? I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud You wasn’t there standing in my shoes” “Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here? I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’ But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close And I saw that his face looked just like mine” Oh! Lord! Just like mine! “And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink That I was just a puppet in a play And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke And a cannonball blew my eyes away” As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand But as he turned to go, he called his mother close And he dropped his medals down into her hand The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course The city fathers they’re trying to endorse The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse But the town has no need to be nervous The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits To Jezebel the nun she violently knits A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits At the head of the chamber of commerce Mama’s in the fact’ry She ain’t got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin’ for the fuse I’m in the streets With the tombstone blues The hysterical bride in the penny arcade Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made” Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade Says, “My advice is to not let the boys in” Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride “Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride You will not die, it’s not poison” Mama’s in the fact’ry She ain’t got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin’ for the fuse I’m in the streets With the tombstone blues Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief Saying, “Tell me great hero, but please make it brief Is there a hole for me to get sick in?” The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly Saying, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry” And dropping a barbell he points to the sky Saying, “The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken” Mama’s in the fact’ry She ain’t got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin’ for the fuse I’m in the streets With the tombstone blues The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves Then sends them out to the jungle Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps With a fantastic collection of stamps To win friends and influence his uncle Mama’s in the fact’ry She ain’t got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin’ for the fuse I’m in the streets With the tombstone blues The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill I would set him in chains at the top of the hill Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B.

My mind weaves a symphony And tapestry of rhyme Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee So it may flow and be To each his own, it’s all unknown If dogs run free If dogs run free, then what must be Must be, and that is all True love can make a blade of grass Stand up straight and tall In harmony with the cosmic sea True love needs no company It can cure the soul, it can make it whole If dogs run free Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon He was an outlaw, that’s for sure More of an outlaw than you ever were Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time I rode with him in a taxi once Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven? Guess I owe You some kind of apology I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living By the saving grace that’s over me By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping In a pine box for all eternity My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping For the saving grace that’s over me Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection Is the saving grace that’s over me Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity As I look around this world all that I’m finding Is the saving grace that’s over me The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it By the saving grace that’s over me I ain’t lookin’ to compete with you Beat or cheat or mistreat you Simplify you, classify you Deny, defy or crucify you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you No, and I ain’t lookin’ to fight with you Frighten you or tighten you Drag you down or drain you down Chain you down or bring you down All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I ain’t lookin’ to block you up Shock or knock or lock you up Analyze you, categorize you Finalize you or advertise you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don’t want to straight-face you Race or chase you, track or trace you Or disgrace you or displace you Or define you or confine you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don’t want to meet your kin Make you spin or do you in Or select you or dissect you Or inspect you or reject you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don’t want to fake you out Take or shake or forsake you out I ain’t lookin’ for you to feel like me See like me or be like me All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you The seasons they are turnin’ and my sad heart is yearnin’ To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? The air is thick and heavy all along the levy Where the geese into the countryside have flown Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? Well, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony The blessings of tranquility Yet I know when the time is right to strike I’ll take you cross the river dear You’ve no need to linger here I know the kinds of things you like The clouds are turnin’ crimson–the leaves fall from the limbs an’ The branches cast their shadows over stone Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? The trailing moss and mystic glow Purple blossoms soft as snow My tears keep flowing to the sea Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief It takes a thief to catch a thief For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me My pulse is runnin’ through my palm–the sharp hills are rising from The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? You have given everything to me What can I do for You? You have given me eyes to see What can I do for You? Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside Filled up a hunger that had always been denied Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide And You’ve chosen me to be among the few What can I do for You? You have laid down Your life for me What can I do for You? You have explained every mystery What can I do for You? Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die? Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do What can I do for You? You have given all there is to give What can I do for You? You have given me life to live How can I live for You? I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through What can I do for You? Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble Ancient footprints are everywhere You can almost think that you’re seein’ double On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs Got to hurry on back to my hotel room Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece She promised that she’d be right there with me When I paint my masterpiece Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum Dodging lions and wastin’ time Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody When I paint my masterpiece Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola! I left Rome and landed in Brussels On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside Newspapermen eating candy Had to be held down by big police Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent When I paint my masterpiece If not for you Babe, I couldn’t find the door Couldn’t even see the floor I’d be sad and blue If not for you If not for you Babe, I’d lay awake all night Wait for the mornin’ light To shine in through But it would not be new If not for you If not for you My sky would fall Rain would gather too Without your love I’d be nowhere at all I’d be lost if not for you And you know it’s true If not for you My sky would fall Rain would gather too Without your love I’d be nowhere at all Oh! what would I do If not for you If not for you Winter would have no spring Couldn’t hear the robin sing I just wouldn’t have a clue Anyway it wouldn’t ring true If not for you If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier She left here last early Spring, is livin\\' there, I hear Say for me that I’m all right though things get kind of slow She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don’t tell her it isn’t so We had a falling-out, like lovers often will And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart She still lives inside of me, we\\'ve never been apart If you get close to her, kiss her once for me I always have respected her for busting out and gettin\\' free Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won\\'t stand in the way Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay I see a lot of people as I make the rounds And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town And I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off Either I\\'m too sensitive or else I\\'m gettin\\' soft Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast If she’s passin’ back this way, I\\'m not that hard to find Tell her she can look me up if she\\'s got the time Down over the window Comes the dazzling sunlit rays Through the back alleys—through the blinds Another one of them endless days Honey bees are buzzin’ Leaves begin to stir I’m in love with my second cousin I tell myself I could be happy forever with her I keep listenin’ for footsteps But I ain’t hearing any From the boat I fish for bullheads I catch a lot, sometimes too many A summer breeze is blowing A squall is settin’ in Sometimes it’s just plain stupid To get into any kind of wind The old men ’round here, sometimes they get On bad terms with the younger men But old, young, age don’t carry weight It doesn’t matter in the end One of the boss’ hangers-on Comes to call at times you least expect Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear It has the opposite effect There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town The old one is long gone Timber two-foot-six across Burns with the bark still on They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it You can just follow your nose It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere We’ll just have to see how it goes My old man, he’s like some feudal lord Got more lives than a cat Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once Things come alive or they fall flat You can smell the pinewood burnin’ You can hear the school bell ring Gotta get up near the teacher if you can If you wanna learn anything Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!” Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off If it bothers you so much” They all got out of here any way they could The cold rain can give you the shivers They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee All the rest of them rebel rivers If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again You do so at the peril of your own life I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife My grandfather was a duck trapper He could do it with just dragnets and ropes My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes I had ’em once though, I suppose, to go along With all the ring-dancin’ Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves I left all my dreams and hopes Buried under tobacco leaves It’s not always easy kicking someone out Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up And tears or not, it’s too much to ask Gonna change my way of thinking Make myself a different set of rules Gonna change my way of thinking Make myself a different set of rules Gonna put my good foot forward And stop being influenced by fools So much oppression Can’t keep track of it no more So much oppression Can’t keep track of it no more Sons becoming husbands to their mothers And old men turning young daughters into whores Stripes on your shoulders Stripes on your back and on your hands Stripes on your shoulders Stripes on your back and on your hands Swords piercing your side Blood and water flowing through the land Well don’t know which one is worse Doing your own thing or just being cool Well don’t know which one is worse Doing your own thing or just being cool You remember only about the brass ring You forget all about the golden rule You can mislead a man You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes You can mislead a man You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes But there’s only one authority And that’s the authority on high I got a God-fearing woman One I can easily afford I got a God-fearing woman One I can easily afford She can do the Georgia crawl She can walk in the spirit of the Lord Jesus said, “Be ready For you know not the hour in which I come” Jesus said, “Be ready For you know not the hour in which I come” He said, “He who is not for Me is against Me” Just so you know where He’s coming from There’s a kingdom called Heaven A place where there is no pain of birth There’s a kingdom called Heaven A place where there is no pain of birth Well the Lord created it, mister About the same time He made the earth ALTERNATE VERSION Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules Put my best foot forward, stop being influenced by fools I’m sittin’ at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse I’m sittin’ at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse I’m gonna revitalize my thinking, I’m gonna let the law take its course Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels We living by the golden rule, whoever got the gold rules The sun is shining, ain’t but one train on this track The sun is shining, ain’t but one train on this track I’m stepping out of the dark woods, I’m jumping on the monkey’s back I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance Every day you got to pray for guidance Every day you got to give yourself a chance Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss A brave man will kill you with a sword, a coward with a kiss Down along the cove I spied my true love comin’ my way Down along the cove I spied my true love comin’ my way I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama It sure is good to see you comin’ today\" Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey I’m so glad you’re my boy!” Down along the cove We walked together hand in hand Down along the cove We walked together hand in hand. Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand I was blinded by the devil Born already ruined Stone-cold dead As I stepped out of the womb By His grace I have been touched By His word I have been healed By His hand I’ve been delivered By His spirit I’ve been sealed I’ve been saved By the blood of the lamb Saved By the blood of the lamb Saved Saved And I’m so glad Yes, I’m so glad I’m so glad So glad I want to thank You, Lord I just want to thank You, Lord Thank You, Lord By His truth I can be upright By His strength I do endure By His power I’ve been lifted In His love I am secure He bought me with a price Freed me from the pit Full of emptiness and wrath And the fire that burns in it I’ve been saved By the blood of the lamb Saved By the blood of the lamb Saved Saved And I’m so glad Yes, I’m so glad I’m so glad So glad I want to thank You, Lord I just want to thank You, Lord Thank You, Lord Nobody to rescue me Nobody would dare I was going down for the last time But by His mercy I’ve been spared Not by works But by faith in Him who called For so long I’ve been hindered For so long I’ve been stalled I’ve been saved By the blood of the lamb Saved By the blood of the lamb Saved Saved And I’m so glad Yes, I’m so glad I’m so glad So glad I want to thank You, Lord I just want to thank You, Lord Thank You, Lord Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion Always on the outside of whatever side there was When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered, “just because” Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast” Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue Joey, Joey King of the streets, child of clay Joey, Joey What made them want to come and blow you away? There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that No one ever knew for sure where they were really at When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim “Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame” But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again” Joey, Joey King of the streets, child of clay Joey, Joey What made them want to come and blow you away? The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with “What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met “Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get” He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike His closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine” Joey, Joey King of the streets, child of clay Joey, Joey Why did they have to come and blow you away? It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun “I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one” Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe” One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork He pushed the table over to protect his family Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy Joey, Joey King of the streets, child of clay Joey, Joey What made them want to come and blow you away? Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep” Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve Joey, Joey King of the streets, child of clay Joey, Joey What made them want to come and blow you away? We carried you in our arms On Independence Day And now you’d throw us all aside And put us on our way Oh what dear daughter ’neath the sun Would treat a father so To wait upon him hand and foot And always tell him, “No?” Tears of rage, tears of grief Why must I always be the thief? Come to me now, you know We’re so alone And life is brief We pointed out the way to go And scratched your name in sand Though you just thought it was nothing more Than a place for you to stand Now, I want you to know that while we watched You discover there was no one true Most ev’rybody really thought It was a childish thing to do Tears of rage, tears of grief Must I always be the thief? Come to me now, you know We’re so low And life is brief It was all very painless When you went out to receive All that false instruction Which we never could believe And now the heart is filled with gold As if it was a purse But, oh, what kind of love is this Which goes from bad to worse? Tears of rage, tears of grief Must I always be the thief? Come to me now, you know We’re so low And life is brief Can’t you hear that rooster crowin’? Rabbit runnin’ down across the road Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through So happy just to see you smile Underneath the sky of blue On this new morning, new morning On this new morning with you Can’t you hear that motor turnin’? Automobile comin’ into style Comin’ down the road for a country mile or two So happy just to see you smile Underneath the sky of blue On this new morning, new morning On this new morning with you The night passed away so quickly It always does when you’re with me Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’? Groundhog runnin’ by the country stream This must be the day that all of my dreams come true So happy just to be alive Underneath the sky of blue On this new morning, new morning On this new morning with you So happy just to be alive Underneath the sky of blue On this new morning, new morning On this new morning with you New morning . . .

I need some Medicaid I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s makin’ me feel afraid What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard ’em too Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love Why would I want to take your life? You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife Tattooed my babies with a poison pen Mocked my God, humiliated my friends I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love Don’t wanna be with nobody tonight Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here? I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love What makes the wind wanna blow tonight? Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away My conscience is beginning to bother me today I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love Every step of the way we walk the line Your days are numbered, so are mine Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape City’s just a jungle; more games to play Trapped in the heart of it, tryin\\' to get away I was raised in the country, I been workin’ in the town I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down Got nothin\\' for you, I had nothin\\' before Don’t even have anything for myself anymore Sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all I was thinkin’ \\'bout the things that Rosie said I was dreaming I was sleepin\\' in Rosie’s bed Walkin\\' through the leaves, falling from the trees Feelin\\' like a stranger nobody sees So many things that we never will undo I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t I need somethin’ strong to distract my mind I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind Well I got here followin\\' the southern star I crossed that river just to be where you are Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin\\' fast I’m drownin’ in the poison, got no future, got no past But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free I’ve got nothin’ but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me Everybody movin’ if they ain’t already there Everybody got to move somewhere Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow Things should start to get interestin\\' right about now My clothes are wet, tight on my skin Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long You took a part of me that I really miss I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you You took the silver, you took the gold You left me standing out in the cold People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep Did so many things I never did intend to do Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low I need every bit of it for the places that I go Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you The last thing you said before you hit the street “Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet” I said, “That’s all right mama . . . you . . . you do what you gotta do” Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel And I’ll rock you too I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you Precious angel, under the sun How was I to know you’d be the one To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone How weak was the foundation I was standing upon? Now there’s spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain’t no neutral ground The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived When the truth’s in our hearts and we still don’t believe? Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself I’m a little too blind to see My so-called friends have fallen under a spell They look me squarely in the eye and they say, “All is well” Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high When men will beg God to kill them and they won’t be able to die? Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed in the same breath You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal’s death Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself I’m a little too blind to see Precious angel, you believe me when I say What God has given to us no man can take away We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves Let us hope they’ve found mercy in their bone-filled graves You’re the queen of my flesh, girl, you’re my woman, you’re my delight You’re the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night But there’s violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Shine your light, shine your light on me Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself I’m a little too blind to see'"
